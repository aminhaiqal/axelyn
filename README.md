# 🇲🇾 AXON
### WhatsApp Automation That Actually Learns — Built for Malaysia First

---

## 🎯 What is Axon?

Axon is **Malaysia's first AI automation platform** that gets smarter with every conversation.

Connect your **WhatsApp Business or Telegram**, and Axon handles customer messages automatically — learning your tone, style, and business logic from feedback. Your virtual assistant that **improves every week without manual tweaking**.

**The secret?** Axon isn't just a chatbot. It's a **learning agent builder** — a node-based AI engine that generates workflows from plain language and **continuously evolves** based on real-world feedback.

> **Think:** The intelligence of ChatGPT + The automation of Zapier + The learning of a trained employee  
> **Result:** Your business running 24/7 while you sleep

## 💔 The Problem Every Malaysian Business Faces

If you run a Malaysian SME, you know this pain intimately:

**Your WhatsApp is drowning you:**
- 200+ messages/day asking the same questions
- "Buka jam berapa?"
- "Ada stok tak?"
- "Boleh delivery ke Subang?"
- "Berapa harga?"

**You have 3 bad options:**
1. ❌ **Reply manually** → 4-6 hours/day wasted, burnt out, missing messages while sleeping/busy
2. ❌ **Hire staff** → RM2,500/month for someone to just handle WhatsApp (RM30,000/year!)
3. ❌ **Use existing chatbots** → Robotic, breaks easily, customers hate it, English-only

**And the worst part?** Every hour you spend on WhatsApp is an hour NOT spent growing your business.

---

### Why Existing Tools Failed Malaysian Businesses

| Tool | Why It Doesn't Work Here |
|------|--------------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | No WhatsApp integration, manual copy-paste, no memory |
| **Zapier/Make** | Too complex, requires technical skill, expensive (USD pricing) |
| **ManyChat/Chatfuel** | Pre-scripted only, feels robotic, breaks on unexpected questions |
| **International AI tools** | No Bahasa Malaysia, no Manglish, no FPX payment, no local support |

**We built Axon because nothing else understood how Malaysian businesses actually work.**

---

## ⚡ How Axon Works (The 5-Minute Setup)

### Step 1: Choose Your Business Type (10 seconds)

Pick from Malaysian business templates:

- 🍽️ **Restoran/Café** → Menu, reservations, operating hours, delivery
- 🛍️ **E-commerce** → Order status, stock checking, pricing, COD/FPX options
- 🏠 **Real Estate** → Property inquiries, viewing schedules, location details
- 💇 **Salon/Spa** → Appointment booking, services, pricing, availability
- 📚 **Tuition Center** → Class schedules, fees, enrollment, trial classes
- 🔧 **Service Business** → Quote requests, booking, service areas, pricing

**Or describe your own:** *"I run a pet grooming business..."*

Axon generates a custom workflow in seconds.

---

### Step 2: Connect Your WhatsApp Business (2 minutes)

- Link your WhatsApp Business account (we guide you)
- Upload your FAQ, price list, menu, or service catalog
- Set your tone: **Professional** / **Friendly** / **Casual**

**No coding. No technical knowledge. Just simple clicks.**

---

### Step 3: Axon Handles Conversations (Automatic)

When a customer messages:
```
👤 Customer: "Boss, pukul berapa buka esok?"

🤖 Axon: "Hi! Kami buka 10 pagi - 10 malam setiap hari 😊 
           Ada apa yang boleh saya bantu?"

👤 Customer: "Boleh delivery ke Subang?"

🤖 Axon: "Boleh! Delivery ke Subang:
           - Charge: RM8
           - Time: 45-60 minit
           - Free delivery untuk order >RM50
           
           Nak order sekarang? 🛵"
```

**Behind the scenes:**
1. **Intent Detection** → Understands what customer wants (even in Manglish!)
2. **Knowledge Retrieval** → Searches your FAQ/docs instantly
3. **Response Generation** → Crafts reply in your brand voice
4. **Context Memory** → Remembers conversation history (200K+ tokens)

All in **<1 second response time**.

---

### Step 4: Teach Axon Your Way (Via WhatsApp)

After each response, you get a notification on WhatsApp:
```
💬 Axon just replied to a customer:

Customer: "Ada discount tak?"
Axon: "Untuk first-time customer, ada 10% off! 
       Code: WELCOME10"

Was this good?
👍 Perfect
👎 Needs improvement  
✏️ Edit: [I would say...]
```

**Tap your choice. That's it.**

Every rating updates Axon's internal "learning graph":
- 👍 **Perfect** → Increases confidence, uses this pattern more
- 👎 **Needs improvement** → Decreases confidence, tries alternative approach
- ✏️ **Edit** → Creates new response branch, learns your exact phrasing

---

### Step 5: Watch It Get Smarter (Automatic)

**Week 1:** 60% success rate  
*Learning your business basics, occasionally needs guidance*

**Week 2:** 75% success rate (+15%)  
*Understanding common questions, adapting tone*

**Week 3:** 85% success rate (+10%)  
*Sounds like your team, handles most scenarios confidently*

**Week 4:** 92% success rate (+7%)  
*Customers can't tell it's AI, proactively helpful*

**No manual prompt engineering. No technical tweaking. It just... learns.**

---

## 🧠 The Technology That Makes This Possible

### What Makes Axon Different: The Learning Agent Builder

Axon isn't a static chatbot. It's a **self-evolving workflow system**.

**Traditional Chatbots:**
```
User message → Match keyword → Send pre-written response
[Fixed, dumb, breaks easily]
```

**Axon's Learning Agent Builder:**
```
User message → Intent Graph → Context Retrieval → 
Response Generation → Feedback Collection → 
Workflow Adjustment → [Repeat, getting smarter]
```

**Every conversation updates the internal "agent graph":**
```
[Incoming Message]
      ↓
[Intent: Delivery Inquiry] ← Confidence: 95% (↑ from 78% last week)
      ↓
[Action: Check delivery zones in Google Sheets]
      ↓
[Generate: Friendly reply with pricing & timing]
      ↓
[Feedback: 👍 8/10 users] → Increases weight of this path
```

Over time, **high-performing paths get reinforced, low-performing ones get replaced**.

This is how Axon "learns your business" without you doing anything.

## 🔥 Why Axon Will Dominate Malaysian Market

### 1. **We Speak Malaysian** (Literally)

**English + Bahasa Malaysia + Manglish** — all in one conversation:
```
Customer: "Boss, esok ada stock tak? Kalau ada, I nak reserve lah."

Axon: "Ada boss! Stock iPhone 15 masih banyak. 
       I dah reserve untuk you. 
       Boleh collect esok 10am-6pm. Okay? 😊"
```

**Competitors:** English-only, or awkward BM translations  
**Axon:** Natural Malaysian conversation flow

---

### 2. **Voice Notes = Game Changer**

Malaysians LOVE voice notes. Axon handles them:
```
🎤 Customer sends voice note (in Manglish):
   "Eh bro, apa masa you tutup ah esok? 
    And got parking tak near your shop?"

🤖 Axon transcribes + understands + responds:
   "Hi! Esok kita tutup pukul 10 malam.
    Ada parking di belakang bangunan, free for customers 🅿️"
```

**No other tool in Malaysia does this properly.**

---

### 3. **Context Memory = Feels Human**

**Scenario:**
```
10:00 AM
Customer: "Ada iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB?"
Axon: "Ada! RM5,299. Want to know more?"

10:05 AM
Customer: "Berapa kalau ambil 2?"
Axon: "For 2 units iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB:
       - Normal: RM10,598
       - Bundle discount: RM10,200 (save RM398!)
       
       Plus free screen protector for both 🎁"
```

Axon remembered the previous context. **Competitors can't do this** (no memory between messages).

---

### 4. **Smart Escalation = No Angry Customers**

Axon knows when it's unsure:

**High Confidence (90%+):**
```
Customer: "What time you open?"
Axon: "We open 10am-10pm daily 😊" [Auto-replies]
```

**Medium Confidence (70-89%):**
```
Customer: "Can I exchange if wrong size?"
Axon: "Yes, you can exchange within 7 days with receipt.
       [But I've also notified boss to double-check]"
```

**Low Confidence (<70%):**
```
Customer: "My order got problem, item rosak!"
Axon: "Oh no! Let me check with boss immediately.
       He'll WhatsApp you within 10 minutes. Sorry for the trouble! 🙏"
[Immediately alerts you with full context]
```

**Your reputation stays safe.** Axon never sends wrong information confidently.

---

### 5. **Malaysian Payment Methods**

**We support what Malaysians actually use:**
- ✅ **FPX** (All Malaysian banks)
- ✅ **DuitNow** (Instant transfer)
- ✅ **Credit/Debit Card** (Backup)

**No international fees. No USD conversion. Pure RM pricing.**

Competitors force you into Stripe USD — Axon uses **Billplz** (Malaysian payment gateway).

## 🇲🇾 Why Build for Malaysia First?

### We're Malaysian. We Get It.

**What makes Axon authentically Malaysian:**

1. **We speak Malaysian** — Not textbook Bahasa, not robotic English. Real Malaysian conversation. "Boleh" not "Can", "esok" not "tomorrow", "tak de" not "don't have".

2. **We know your payment reality** — FPX first, DuitNow second, credit card last. Not Stripe-only USD like foreign tools.

3. **We understand your customers** — They WhatsApp at 11pm asking "besok buka ke?" They send voice notes. They mix 3 languages in one sentence. They expect instant replies.

4. **We price for Malaysian SMEs** — RM99/month, not RM500+/month. We know hiring staff costs RM2,500/month. We know every ringgit matters.

5. **We build for Malaysian infrastructure** — Works on 4G (not just fiber). Dashboard loads fast even on older phones. Simple UI (no confusing tech jargon).

**This isn't a Silicon Valley product adapted for Malaysia.**  
**This is built from the ground up for Malaysian businesses by Malaysians who've run Malaysian businesses.**
