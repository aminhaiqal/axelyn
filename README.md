# AXON

## AI Automation That Actually Learns

---

## What is Axon?

Axon is an AI automation platform that gets smarter with every run.

Unlike traditional automation tools that execute the same workflow forever, Axon learns from your feedback and continuously improves its performance ‚Äî turning static robots into adaptive AI assistants.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

If you've used Zapier, Make, or n8n, you know the frustration:

- ‚ùå **Hours of manual setup** ‚Äî Endless clicking through UI builders
- ‚ùå **Static workflows** ‚Äî Set once, runs the same way forever
- ‚ùå **Constant maintenance** ‚Äî When it breaks, YOU fix it manually
- ‚ùå **No adaptation** ‚Äî Can't learn your preferences or improve over time
- ‚ùå **One-size-fits-all outputs** ‚Äî Same response for every situation

**You're not automating. You're babysitting robots.**

Every automation tool today executes instructions. None of them learn.

---

## How Axon Works

### 1. Describe What You Want (Natural Language)

No more clicking through UI builders. Just tell Axon what you want in plain English:

> *"When I get an email to support@mycompany.com, read it, search our FAQ for relevant answers, and draft a helpful reply in a friendly tone."*

### 2. Axon Builds It Automatically

Our AI engine converts your description into a working automation in seconds:
- Connects to your tools (Gmail, Slack, databases, etc.)
- Generates the workflow logic
- Activates it immediately

No configuration. No manual setup. Just working automation.

### 3. Rate Each Result

After each automation runs, you see the output and give quick feedback:

- üëç **Good** ‚Äî It worked perfectly
- üëé **Needs improvement** ‚Äî Too formal, missed context, etc.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Add details** ‚Äî "Be more casual" or "Always include pricing"

### 4. Watch It Get Smarter

Axon uses your feedback to continuously improve:

- **Week 1:** 65% success rate ‚Äî Some responses too formal, occasionally misses key info
- **Week 2:** 78% success rate ‚Äî Learning your tone, better context understanding  
- **Week 3:** 91% success rate ‚Äî Feels like a trained assistant who knows your style

**All without you manually tweaking prompts or reconfiguring workflows.**

## What Makes Axon Different

### vs. Traditional Automation (Zapier, Make, n8n)

| Traditional Automation | Axon |
|------------------------|------|
| Hours of manual UI setup | Describe in plain English, instant automation |
| Static workflows that never change | Learning system that improves continuously |
| Same output every time | Adapts based on context and feedback |
| You fix everything manually | Axon self-corrects and evolves |
| Set once, runs forever unchanged | Gets 2-3x better in 2-3 weeks |

### vs. AI Chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude)

| AI Chatbots | Axon |
|-------------|------|
| One-off conversations | Automated, recurring workflows |
| Manual copy-paste | Integrated with your tools |
| No memory of what works | Learns from every interaction |
| You prompt every time | Runs automatically in background |

**Axon is the bridge:** The automation of Zapier + The intelligence of ChatGPT + The learning of a trained assistant.

## Our Philosophy

### Automation Should Feel Like Training, Not Programming

Traditional automation = Writing detailed instructions for a robot that never learns

Axon automation = Training an assistant who adapts to your preferences over time

### Intelligence Over Integration

We're not trying to connect to 5,000 apps on Day 1.

We're focused on making the automations you create **actually smart** ‚Äî learning, adapting, improving.

More integrations will come, driven by what our users need most.

### Transparent Learning

You should always see:
- How your automation is improving
- What it learned from your feedback  
- Why it made a specific decision

No black box. No magic. Just clear, visible intelligence.

## Technology

**Built with:**
- **AI Engine:** Claude 4 (Anthropic) for natural language understanding and generation
- **Learning System:** Few-shot learning with feedback-based prompt refinement
- **Architecture:** Composable automation nodes (agents calling agents)
- **Storage:** Encrypted runs, feedback, and performance data
- **Integrations:** OAuth 2.0 for secure connection to user tools

**Future capabilities:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this different from Zapier?
Zapier executes static workflows. Axon learns and improves. If a Zapier workflow produces wrong outputs, you manually fix it. If an Axon automation produces wrong outputs, you rate them poorly, and it automatically adjusts to do better next time.

### Do I need to know how to code?
No. You describe what you want in plain English. Axon builds it for you. No coding, no UI clicking, no technical configuration required.

### What if I want to change something?
Just tell Axon in natural language: "Make the tone more casual" or "Always include pricing in responses." It updates automatically.

### How long does it take to see improvement?
Most users see measurable improvement within 1-2 weeks. Typical trajectory: 60-70% accuracy at start ‚Üí 85-95% accuracy by week 3.

### What happens to my data?
Your data is encrypted and never used to train public models. We only use your feedback to improve YOUR specific automations. Enterprise tier will offer self-hosting for complete data control.

### Can I export my automations?
Yes. You own your automations. Export as JSON, port to other platforms, or self-host (Enterprise tier).

### What integrations do you support?
Currently: Gmail, Slack, Notion, Google Docs. Adding new integrations based on user demand. Request specific integrations during beta.

### Is there a free trial?
Yes. Free tier includes 50 runs/month permanently. Pro tier has 14-day free trial (no credit card required).
